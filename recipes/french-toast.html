        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
        French Toast, also known as "eggy bread" or "pain perdu" in French,
        is a classic breakfast dish made from slices of bread soaked in a
        mixture of beaten eggs, milk, and often flavored with vanilla,
        cinnamon, and a touch of sugar. The soaked bread slices are then
        cooked on a griddle or in a frying pan until they are golden brown
        and slightly crispy on the outside, with a soft and custardy interior.
        It's a simple yet delicious dish that is often served with a variety
        of toppings such as maple syrup, powdered sugar, fresh fruits, or
        whipped cream. French Toast is a popular breakfast choice that
        combines the comforting flavors of eggs, bread, and warm spices.
