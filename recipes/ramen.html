        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
        Ramen noodle soup is a Japanese dish known for its delicious
        combination of chewy wheat noodles and flavorful broth. It typically
        includes various toppings and ingredients such as sliced meats
        (commonly pork or chicken), soft-boiled or marinated eggs, nori
        seaweed, green onions, and bean sprouts. The broth can vary in flavor,
        with options like miso, shoyu (soy sauce), or tonkotsu
        (pork bone broth), each offering a unique and savory taste.
        Ramen is a hearty and comforting meal that has gained popularity
        worldwide for its rich and satisfying flavors.
